<p align="center">A cross-platform GUI of my simple finance tracking program.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
Simple and functional cross-platform finance tracking GUI app, written in C with absolutely no external dependencies.

While the code may not be of the highest quality, hopefully it will beat the terminal version of this app :)

<h3>Features</h3>

- All finances are stored in a JSON file
- Simple and easy to use user interface
- Multi-language support (maybe)

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Requirements</h3>

- Operating system: Linux, Windows or macOS (can't test on macOS, so you're on your own there)
- Compiler: gcc (or any other compiler with C99 support)

<h3>Installation / Building</h3>
Similarly to the original, I'm not providing any executables or distro-specific packages, so you need to compile it yourself.<br><br>

To compile, use the provided bash script:
```
$ ./make.sh
```
And make sure it's executable:
```
$ chmod +x make.sh
```
After that, move the executable to anywhere in your PATH to access it anywhere, or create a shortcut for easy access.
